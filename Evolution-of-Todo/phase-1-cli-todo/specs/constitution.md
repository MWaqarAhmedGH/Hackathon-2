# Project Constitution — Phase 1

## Purpose
This project is a learning-focused hackathon project for a student.
The goal is to build a simple CLI-based Todo application using
Spec-Driven Development and AI-assisted coding.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. The student must NOT manually write application logic.
2. All application code must be generated by an AI model.
3. The student may only:
   - create folders and files
   - paste AI-generated code
   - refine specifications if behavior is incorrect

## Technical Constraints

1. Programming Language: Python
2. Allowed Libraries: Python Standard Library ONLY
3. Data Storage: In-memory only (no files, no databases)
4. Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)
5. Platform: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Scope Control

1. Only features explicitly mentioned in the specification
   are allowed.
2. No additional features, optimizations, or enhancements
   beyond the specification.
3. No future-proofing or over-engineering.

## Quality Guidelines

1. Code must be beginner-friendly and readable.
2. Functions should be small and clearly named.
3. Clear separation between user interaction and logic.
4. Errors should be handled gracefully where specified.

## Phase Rule

This constitution applies ONLY to Phase 1.
Future phases may extend or override these rules.
